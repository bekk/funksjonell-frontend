#Day 3 - Redux
##Introduction
Welcome to day 3, and the last day of the course - Functional programming in JavaScript with React and Redux. Today we are going to have a look at Redux - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps. We will continue where we left at day 2 and finish up the Memory game in Redux pattern style.

First of all we will have a recap of some basic React to ensure that everyone knows the concepts from day 2. We will then start introducing the concepts of actions, reducer and explain how the data flows through your application. For more information about Redux, see [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

Remember, we are here to help you learn. Do not hesitate to ask questions. We will walk around and help you with the assignments. Don't hesitate to ask us if you're stuck!

LetÂ´s get started!
